## 📚 Contribution Rules

* You are **allowed** to make fun or experimental pull requests — we merge them all.
* Do **not** add build steps (e.g., `npm install`) — this should remain a **simple static project**.
* Do **not** remove existing content.
* Your code or styling can be **clean, creative, or even a bit messy** — as long as it works.
* Keep pull requests **small** to minimize merge conflicts.
